## Log
Following my longest surf hiatus in almost a year, I paddled out for a chill session at Tourmaline. I pulled into  the parking lot and immediately got excited after seeing a few set waves break WAY past PB point on the beach side. I thought, well, not as chill as we expected, but looks damn fun.

I paddled out at 5:45ish and stayed out till 7:10. I caught a nice set wave as soon as I paddled out, but then had a bit of a lull as I waited 20 or so minutes for the next one. Mike paddled out on his short ass board. I don't expect he caught a ton of waves- no idea why he does it to himself. 

The Bing was the perfect choice for the day. I was able to get playful on a few rights, and am really starting to fine tune my bottom turning. My new Josh Hall board should be ready soon, I'm getting giddy to give it the college try.

Overall an amazing first session back in the water. Hopefully this is the last time I'm out of surf more a week or more!
