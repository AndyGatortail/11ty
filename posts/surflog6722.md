## Log
Today was a beaut. Combo swell conditions precipitated by a long period SW and short period NW wind swell. Peaky little runners both inside and out.

I finally got the 5'10 Josh Hall last week and have been LOVING it. It seems to have the volume I need where I need it, but is fairly responsive and FAST. I'm catching fast breaking waves and (generally) staying ahead of the curl. 

I caught a few mediocre waves today, but I'm getting in tune with the board. I'm catching waves easy, but I need to develop the muscle memory to pump speed as soon as I'm up on the board. A few of the waves I took today could have been seriously improved with a little more speed. I'm starting to feel the twin fin bottom turn as well- if I can get it wired, I'll be zooming right back up the face of the wave.

Overall 3-4 star day. I'm hoping for some cleaner conditions to show up, but for now, I'm pretty damn happy with what we've got.
