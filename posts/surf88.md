## Log
It's been a while, World- nice to be back. I'm going to try to be more consistent with the surf log from here on out. Today was an incredibly fun day of soft, summer surf. The water was glassy and clean, with a few dolphins blowing spray throughout the morning. Nothing better than appreciating the magnificence of a 700lbs. sea creature that can surf better than you.

The waves were decent sized but fairly gutless with the high tide overpowering the 7 second dominant swell direction. It seemed like the sets were fighting to stand up. I would say close outs were the norm, though there were a few corners to be found if you're looking at the right waves. 

The Bing is REALLY surfing these days. I thought I caught a nice little barrel, but the surf cam showed otherwise. I was fairly close, but need to work on engaging my rail and trailing my inside arm immediately after take off. THE BARREL IS INEVITABLE
